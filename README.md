# Data_Collection_Pipeline
As shopping online becomes a household lifestyle, ecommerce affects people in all walks of life. Online sellers, storefront retailers and even consumers are all ecommerce data collectors. ASOS is a British online fashion and cosmetic retailer which sells over 850 brands as well as its own range of clothing and accessories. For any e-commerence business, it is important to analyse competitor's product information, including brand, prices, review scores, review numbers and product photos. This is a web scraper project which scrapes product information from [ASOS website](https://www.asos.com/).
